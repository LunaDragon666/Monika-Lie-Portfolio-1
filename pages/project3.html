                      I didn’t get to work as much with this project as I wanted due to limited health and low energy-level I’ve experience while I was working on this task, and therefore will deliver a small submission of it (what I managed to do so far). With a small submission for this project, I mean that I was just able to work with the homepage and the layout of this website is still not completely finish. But I will focus mostly on what I’ve achieved so far. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For this part of the submission, I have made some changes with the cross-course project I submitted when we had the course assignment in «Content Management Systems». Many of the codes entered for this project hasn’t undergone too many changes, however I have again changed the way the content and elements of the website is previewed, and from there tried to be more aware of the use of media queries in this context with responsive design in mind.

                    <h3>What was changed</h3> 
                    <p>
                      First of all, I have like in the semester project 1, changed the GameHub logo I redesigned earlier from png- to svg-file to make it look a little sharper in picture even in smaller screen sizes. Again, I see that PNG-versions of logos are not always as sharp as desired, and it seems to depend on what size we put it on.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Apart from the fact that I didn’t manage to recreate or redesign the details page for each product (game), I have mostly kept the same js functions on this site like the search-field and filter section – even though I still think that they’re not completely optimal to use.  
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                      And when it comes to search- and filter functions for this site, I have chosen to remove the function where users could choose how many products (or games in this case) they want a showcase of, since there’s no point to have it for now when not many games are currently added to the API data through WP. The only thing that I was not happy with about the search bar is that I didn’t manage to figure out how to display loading indicator after clicking on the search button after searching for a game name or title there (for example, Bee Simulator or Tomb Raider game(s). The same should also happen when clicking on one of the categories (also struggled to make featured in categories to just display all available games when clicking on featured and not just show empty results with nothing) to make them work more properly and user-friendly. These are one of many parts of the website building I don’t feel that I have fully mastered yet, but which I still practice when and as soon as these opportunities strikes to me.  
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                      Other significant changes that have been made is that I have created a navigation bar with two menus – a «main menu» and a menu for users like login, wishlist and cart/checkout which are currently not in use. Then I made a header for this page that is built in similar way as from the CSM website (which were supposed to be built as a kind of slider-header in mind). Apart from these things, what I can think of so far, I have otherwise only changed the color palette, changed back to original font type and edited website’s «whitespace-rooms».

                  <div class="text-card">
                    <h3>How I changed that</h3> 
                    <p>
                      The website is almost built exclusively by using flexboxes, with the exception of game products preview that are displayed in CSS Grid. Flexboxes defines for me fast and simple how I want to display different elements across the page based on the different parts of the website I want to modify and change. For instance, when I make the navbar elements display in different ways even when both are displayed in flex – the main menu is controlled by justify-content, while the user-section is flex-wrapped. For the grid-part of this site, I used min-max so that the grid-columns change automatically, flexible from one screen size to another without having to change that manually through media queries. 
                    </p> 
                    <h3>Why I did it that way</h3> 
                    <p>
                      Before I started using CSS Grid more frequently, I usually used flexbox to design web pages for whatever purpose and content they had. Here for now I have small design elements to implement — and this is where I could see almost purely flexbox-built website were ideal when I have smaller layout design to build and implements on, with few rows- or columns. But, then I ended up using CSS Grid anyway when the game products are previewed on the page, because it is easier for me to shape the layout of the section, in this case, in the rows and columns I had in mind with grid when there are several elements (games) to display. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Thought after the first year I would figure out what I personally prefer and think it's most practical to use of Flexbox and CSS Grid; and so far I can tell from my view that it will depend on the type and amount of content that has to be organized across the website, or maybe this matter of fact this is more about preferences?
