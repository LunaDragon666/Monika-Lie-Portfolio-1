                    <p>
                        Since I don’t have finished Project Exam 1 work to showcase for now, I’ve in this case updated/edited previous JavaScript 1 CA site created earlier this year where I’ve used public API URL to fetch existing data there (Margarita drinks). This assignment was based on a similar consept as the project exam, but is considered less extensive than the other two projects.

                    <h3>What was changed</h3> 
                    <p>
                        From homepage, where API data is visually presented, I’ve switched from using flexbox to CSS Grid to preview these, to make it easier for me to add a media query or more, and shuffle around the items and sizes of those however I want. When it comes to the display of the navigation bar, I only have the main links to the page on the left and a search bar on the right side (with the idea that users could use it to search for drink names with recipes, which I didn’t make the time to add using JavaScript).  
                        The contact form hasn’t undergone so many drastic changes, other than that the first two inputs are placed next to each other, while the third are below the first two inputs and the “adress” input is presented as a textarea box – like a “message” field. 
                        For details.html, three of the properties from API are previewed for one of the drink images we click on from index.html (will vary from drink to drink in this case). This subpage for each API is meant to retrieve each API’s id (mostly there for practice purpose and due to assignment’s requirement(s)). Otherwise, this site has also gone through little changes.   
                    </p>
                    <h3>How I changed that</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Here I focused mostly on changing the layout so that it looks the way it was supposed to look in the first place, which I at that time didn’t have enough skills and knowledge to manage to do. For instance, create visually equal height to different types of content inside “grid-cards” when some of the API data have more properties, text and/or content than others by using flexbox. Instead of presenting ingredients lists in ul and li tags, I used table tags and other (sub) tags belonging to it to present side by side measurements and ingredients - as they sometimes use to be visually presented in cookbooks. In retrospect, it is also conceivable that we also could achieve the same result with ul and li with flexbox?  
                        When I made the two-column form inputs I used and tested out float property (one of many ways to accomplish the one and same task).
                    </p>  
                  </div>
                </article>
                <article class="card">
                  <div class="card-body">
                    <h3>Why I did it that way</h3> 
                    <p>
                        The way I have updated the homepage and how API data is presented to visitors there, was with the thought of creating a sense of visually balance, equal-looking proportion and harmony by using symmetry elements design scheme. In addition, I’ve tried to put more into the diligent use of the term white space (visual “breathing room” in webdesign) into practice, by in this case use some kind of “maximum limit” to the width of each page in CSS and the elements inside the pages. 
                        Some of the elements are usually centered to make the reading and “scanning” experience easier for visitors in mind. While the “grid-items” flexboxes and text inputs and such are usually left-aligned because left aligned text (paragraphs) makes it easier for the user’s eyes to work less to find where the line starts when reading or scan-reading each “grid-card”, and to potentially visually filter out different type of content inside of it – like where to find ingredients list and instructions that belong to each of them.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another change I have made with the page that I was about to forget to mention is that I have changed the font type(s) that appears to try to create a slightly more personal touch to the site and its content. The main font has an appearance that looks like an sans-serif version of a calligraphic-like handwriting, to kind of capture the personality to the content; some combination of sweet, salty and sour look of the site, with some elegant touch that I tried to bring in through the “Margaritas” signature from the homepage. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, for the colors I made some small adjustments to the color palette dominated by some shades of yellow-green, a consistent color in some of the margarita drinks and the colors that might be associated with the collection or collective term of margarita, even though margaritas comes in a variety of flavors and colors in reality.
                        I would also like to say that I have changed the way the CSS-files and folders are sorted and imported, with the intention for me to dividing the code for each html-page and web page layout into smaller parts where it’s thought appropriate.
