                    <p>
                        Here I have made changes based on the feedback(s) I have received from the examiner and based on changes I saw that could be appropriate to do. Subsequently, I’m still seeing some elements and parts of this website I might should have done differently, but now I will choose to focus on the changes (possibly improvements – even potential, thought pitfalls) I’ve managed to make within the time frame I set to make these.

                    <h3>What was changed</h3> 
                    <p>
                        The first thing I did was to add two more subpages I didn’t get the chance to create in time the first time I worked on this semester project which is about- and “visit-us” pages to give the website more content to the users and make it look a little more complete perhaps. I didn’t create these pages exactly as I did in the XD prototypes, which I will explain why later. 
                        After that, I supplemented between Flexboxes- and CSS Grid types, where I took the liberty to experiment and test out these, to redesign other subpages (exhibitions-, workplace- and contact pages) to create more of variety in how different types of content are previewed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both contact form- and homepage are the pages that have undergone least changes (at all and visually), which I believe has nevertheless undergo some significant changes after all. In the contact form I have formatted the codes more properly from the feedback I’ve received for it and added form validation with JavaScript to make it more interactive. From both the contact form and the homepage content layout, I focused mostly on creating some more whitespace than what the pages had before which I also tried to make a consistency to it throughout the whole website.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the navigation bar and footer field, I this time have made it so that the navigation bar changes according to different types of screen sizes (so that the hamburger menu is showing on both mobile- and tablet screens, while on laptops- and desktops all links from the navbar are displayed and not hidden inside a hamburger menu). This time I also have made footer content as it was planned to make it, with some small adjustments from the XD prototypes.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end, I have chosen to add hotjar code to the website since I want to get a bigger picture of how to improve the site’s user experience – whether there is something missing or some elements that can create problems with the user experience, but also what already works. I want to investigate these things further through hotjar and usertesting before I’ll adjusting and previewing the work for future employers/costumers (and showcase in future, official portfolio that is under construction now – this portfolio is just a draft at the moment).

                    <h3>How I changed that</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have used another way(s) to create similar and somehow different types of flexboxes or something that looks similar from like “get involved” and “our exhibitions” from the previous version of the website, since I experienced that the procedure I used earlier to create these flexboxes was not as flexible to adjust and customizable in media queries. With for example grid-template-areas I felt I’ve achieved the same or similar results, but which also gave me more freedom to place different elements and content in the order(s) I wanted and the flexibility to change these that doesn’t have to be in chronological orders. That kind of approach to content building I have adopted further in one of the content section part of “about” and in “exhibition”. For “get involved” I also used CSS Grid, only that they are built in grid-template-columns (like aslo I did inside the exhibition-section from homepage) instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I created the hamburger menu, I used both simple CSS animation and addEventListener with JavaScript, although I also have earlier created menus that are not dependent on JS to create a functional mobile menu. While for footer I used table to build the footer columns which I figured out from now has created for me some complications when I had to adapt it to smaller screen sizes through media queries – where I consider next time to maybe try other methods to create footer columns like flexbox instead. Another small thing I also did was that I changed the logo from PNG- to SVG-file in Adobe Illustrator to make the logo more progressive sharper looking than what it was in PNG-version of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For “visit”, and some of the parts from the “about” page and the blog-section from homepage, I used there flex-wrap when little or no code there is needed in media queries – the content there somehow adapts itself from one screen size to another. At the end, I also tried to smoothen more the hover animations with CSS transitions to make them appear more natural.        
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why I did it that way</h3> 
                    <p>
                        All the changes I’ve made were mainly to find simpler and more flexible ways to build content and customize them more freely for different devices, which also could possibly make it least painful user experience as possible – make it look as good as possible from mobile- to desktop.
