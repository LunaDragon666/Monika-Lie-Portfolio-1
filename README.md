# Portfolio 1 
#### Note
To find the links to both previous- and new versions of each project's GitHub and Netlify, they will be found inside the portfolio site when one of the projects are clicked on. When we're one of the project's detail page, to get back to the portfolio (home) page, we can click on the back button next to each project's heading that looks like this: 'hello'.
